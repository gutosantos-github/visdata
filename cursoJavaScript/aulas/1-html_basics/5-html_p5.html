        The <span> element is an inline container used to mark up a part of a text, or a part of a document.
        The <span> element has no required attributes, but style, class and id are common.  
        When used together with CSS, the <span> element can be used to style parts of the text:
    -->
    <p>My mother has <span style="color:blue;font-weight:bold;">blue</span> eyes and my father has <span style="color:darkolivegreen;font-weight:bold;">dark green</span> eyes.</p>
    <p>This is an inline span <span style="border: 1px solid black">Hello World</span> element inside a paragraph.</p>
    <p>The SPAN element is an inline element, and will not start on a new line and only takes up as much width as necessary.</p>
